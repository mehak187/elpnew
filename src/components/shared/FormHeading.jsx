 * The heading of a section, or of a form that opened over one.
 *
 * Two marks are always there: the rule down the left, and the icon. The icon
 * is what tells this heading apart from the page's own heading above it -
 * without one, two bold blue lines in the same column read as the same thing
 * said twice. The way back is not always there: it belongs only where the form
 * took the whole page, so there is nothing behind it to look at. Where the list
 * is still underneath, an arrow would offer to leave a page nobody left.
