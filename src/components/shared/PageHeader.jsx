/**
 * The head of a page: where it sits, what it is, what it holds, and what can
 * be added to it.
 *
 * Every list in the system is topped by the same parts in the same places, so
 * they are written once here rather than a dozen times over. The trail above
 * the title is read from the header's own menus rather than passed in by each
 * page: one list of where pages live, so a page moved between menus cannot go
 * on claiming the old one.
 *
 * The action sits at the logical end of the title's row - a person looking up
 * from the table finds the page's name and the way to add to it together,
 * instead of hunting for the button among the search and filter controls.
