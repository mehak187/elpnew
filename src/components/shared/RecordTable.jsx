 * The one table every list of records is drawn with.

 * Standard 07: the body is frameless. There are no lines between columns -
 * only a rule under each row - because the padding already separates one
 * column from the next, and a full grid of lines competes with the data it is
 * supposed to be organising. The frame is a single outer border with the
 * container radius, and no shadow: a list is part of the page, not something
 * floating over it.
 *
 * Anything a particular table needs on top of that is passed as a class; the
 * frame itself is not re-described in each file.
 *
 * Text reads from the logical start and money from the logical end, the way a
 * ledger is read - `text-end` on an amount column is for that, and it goes on
 * the heading and the cells together so the figures line up under their name.
 * Logical rather than left and right, so the whole thing turns round in
 * Arabic instead of staying put.
