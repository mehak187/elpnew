 * A list of counts, drawn as bars against the largest of them.

 * compare: the eye has to read each number and hold it. A bar measured against
 * the biggest answers "where is the work" before a single number is read, so
 * the same data says more in the same space.
 *
 * The firm's dashboard and a client's both use it, so a breakdown looks the
 * same wherever it is read.
