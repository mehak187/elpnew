 * Expense taxonomy.
 *
 * The four general types - Office, Administrative & Financial, Marketing and
 * Other - follow the strict three-level structure the General Invoices
 * specification sets out:
 *
 *   Expense Type -> Category -> Subcategory
 *
 * The types that belong to their own records (cases, employees, partners,
 * assets) are kept here too. They are not raised through General Invoices, but
 * the client asked that none of that work be removed - each will be surfaced on
 * its own page.
 *
 * `link` names the record such an expense must be tied to, so choosing one of
 * those types reveals a mandatory record picker.
